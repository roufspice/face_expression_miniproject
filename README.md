# face_expression_miniproject

Face emotional expression classification using fer2013 datasets and images which is collected on Google images by crawling with a Tensorflow.Keras CNN models (XCEPTION and VGG16) and openCV

-  fer2013 + myDataset(google crawling images) facial expression test accuracy: 69.52%
-  fer2013 + myDataset(google crawling images) facial expression test accuracy(Hard voting): 77.13%
